== Spy JDBC Interceptor

Spy uses auto-generated relay & listener classes for each JDBC API interface to provide an easy method to
intercept calls to the JDBC API. Currently it provides the JDBC API level tracing functionality for {drivername}
(see <<tracing-jdbc>>).

Although the library is used as a tracing system for {drivername} it should be able to be used with any compliant
JDBC driver.

=== Connection Wrapping

To use the library as a API tracing system you have three options to wrap connections and enable tracing:

==== Manual
Manually wrapping the a connection returned from a JDBC `Driver` or `DataSource` and using the wrapped connection
as normal provides an easy way to programmatically decide when to add or disable tracing.

[source,java]
.Manually wrapping an opened connection
----
Connection conn = ConnectionTracer(DriverManager.getConnection(...), FileTracer("api.trace"))
----

==== Driver
If you are acquiring connections using the JDBC Driver API (as opposed to the DataSource API) a more declarative
method can be used by altering the URL used to connect to your server.

Simply prepending the driver scheme of the JDBC URL with `:spy` and leaving the URL in its original form will
cause the library to automatically wrap all connections.

[source,java]
.Use special JDBC URL to enable tracing
----
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:spy:pgjdbc://localhost/db");
----

==== Automatic

{drivername} has built in support for tracing using the library, see <<tracing-jdbc>>.


=== Beyond Tracing
Spy generates a Relay class and matching Listener interface for each interface in the JDBC API. To support detailed
tracing an implementation of each Listener interface is generated that produces trace output.

Due to the way its structured the library can be used to do a lot more than tracing by implementing custom
Listener interfaces and wrapping connections using one of the methods previously outlined.
