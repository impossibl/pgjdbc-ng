[[release-notes-0.8-pgjdbc-ng-udt]]
=== PGJDBC-NG UDT Generator

The UDT generator is a "suggested" feature of JDBC 4.2. Although one has existed for {drivername}, it
previously was a separate project and was not documented or updated.  It's now part of the main project,
documented in the new "User Guide" and will be released and updated as normal.


[[release-notes-0.8-pgjdbc-ng-spy]]
=== PGJDBC-NG Spy

Spy is a general purpose library that (see User Guide) that {drivername} uses internally to provide
JDBC API level tracing.
